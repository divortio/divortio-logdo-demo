# Divortio LogDO Demo & Inspector

This project provides a front-end demonstration and inspection tool for the data collected
by **[Divortio LogDO](https://github.com/divortio/divortio-logdo)**, a high-performance, zero-latency logging service
for Cloudflare Workers.

This demo application fetches a log entry from a deployed `divortio-log-do` service via an RPC call and renders all 50+
data points in a clean, scannable, three-column layout. It serves as both a showcase of the rich data captured and a
practical tool for inspecting individual log entries.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Live Log Inspection**: Acts as a client to a deployed `divortio-log-do` service to display real log data.
* **Offline Debug Mode**: Includes a complete set of embedded dummy data, activated with a `?debug=true` URL parameter,
  for local testing and UI development without a live backend.
* **Comprehensive Data Display**: Renders every field from the `divortio-log-do` schema, including enriched security
  signals, identity tracking, and detailed connection information.
* **Concise & Scannable UI**: Presents complex log data in a clean, three-column layout using tables for a compact and
  easy-to-read format.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment via GitHub

This project is designed for easy deployment using Cloudflare's "Connect to Git" feature.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying this demo, you must have an instance of
the **[divortio-logdo](https://github.com/divortio/divortio-logdo)** service already deployed to your Cloudflare
account.

### Step 1: Clone and Configure

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/divortio/divortio-logdo-demo.git](https://github.com/divortio/divortio-logdo-demo.git)
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory and open `wrangler.toml`.
3. Modify the file to match your Cloudflare setup:

   ```toml
   # wrangler.toml

   # 1. Set the name for your worker
   name = "divortio-logdo-demo"
   main = "src/worker.mjs"
   compatibility_date = "2025-08-21"

   # ... other settings

   # 2. Configure the static assets binding (no changes usually needed)
   [assets]
   directory = "./public"

   # 3. Set the custom domain for this demo page
   [[routes]]
   pattern = "log-demo.your-domain.com" # <-- CHANGE THIS
   custom_domain = true

   # 4. Bind your deployed logger service
   [[services]]
   binding = "LOGGER" # This MUST be "LOGGER"
   service = "divortio-log-do" # <-- This MUST be the name of your deployed LogDO worker
   ```

### Step 2: Push to Your Private Repository

1. Create a new **private** repository on GitHub.
2. Update the remote origin for your local clone and push the code:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin [https://github.com/YourUsername/your-private-repo.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/your-private-repo.git)
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy on Cloudflare

1. In the Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to **Workers & Pages** and click **Create application**.
2. Select the **Connect to Git** tab.
3. Choose your newly created private repository and click **Begin setup**.
4. Cloudflare will detect the `wrangler.toml` settings. Verify the project name.
5. Click **Save and Deploy**.

Your LogDO demo page will now be deployed and connected to your logging service.

---

## üîå Usage

Once deployed, you can visit the custom domain you configured in `wrangler.toml` to see a live log entry.

To test the UI locally or without a live backend, open the `public/index.html` file in your browser and
append `?debug=true` to the URL. This will load the embedded dummy data.
